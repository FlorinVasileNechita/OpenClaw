# OpenClaw - Captain Claw (1997) reimplementation

 - This project is a multiplatform C++ reimplementation of original Captain Claw (1997) platformer game
 - Whole codebase was written from scratch
 - Game uses assets from original game archive (CLAW.REZ)

# Tech

  - SDL2 Libraries (SDL2, SDL_Image, SDL_TTF, SDL_Mixer, SDL2_Gfx) for graphics, input, font and audio
  - Box2D Library for Physics
  - Tinyxml library for data-driven approach

# Building and running
For all platforms you will need original CLAW.REZ game archive from original game
### Windows
  - Project contains VS2017 solution with all libraries and include directories preset
  - Project also contains CMake files if you want to use other IDEs.
  - Box2D is generated by CMake and it hardcodes the file paths. If you want to compile it on your own, you must run CMake on the CMakeLists.txt in the Box2D root directory
  - Do not try to use different versions of SDL libraries than the ones which are already included in the Build_Release folder

### Linux
  **Prerequisites for Ubuntu 16.04 (should be almost identical for Fedora/CentOS/*):**
  
  `sudo apt install libsdl2-dev  libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libsdl2-gfx-dev libtinyxml-dev` 
  
  **Compilation:**
  - `git clone https://github.com/pjasicek/OpenClaw.git`
  - `cd OpenClaw/Build_Release`
  - CLAW.REZ iz required from original game in the OpenClaw/Build_Release folder
  - `make` (it's going to use all threads to compile, edit Makefile in Build_Release folder to whatever number of simultaneous threads you want it on your machine to run)

 **Remarks:**

  - For hearing background music play, you need to install **timidity (or timidity++)** and **freepats**. Some linux distributions come with it by default, some do not (fedora, archlinux)
  - Does not work with SDL 2.0.6 - if you have the latest one from repository, you should be fine
  
### Android
  
  - Compilation / Deployment steps will be updated in near future, game itself is successfully running on Android
  
### WebAssembly (Emscripten)
  
  The project can be compiled as wasm code. This code is executed by modern web browsers without any additional runtime dependencies. Compiled once this code can work on any devices with different operation systems.
  
  **Compilation:**
  - Install [Emscripten SDK](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html) from official website. I'm not sure that compilation will be successful on a Windows platform. If you use Windows then don't show off, enable Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), download Linux-like system (for example, Ubuntu) from Windows Store and install Emscripten SDK. It should be something like:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git
    cd emsdk
    ./emsdk install latest
    ./emsdk activate latest
    source ./emsdk_env.sh
    # Try to use latest version.
    # If it doesn't work the project was successfully compiled on 1.39.5 version.
    ```
  - Make sure you have *python* and *cmake* packages. Ubuntu: `sudo apt install python cmake`.
  - Zip all content inside `Build_Release/ASSETS` directory to `ASSETS.ZIP` file.
  - Create build directory in project root directory as `mkdir build`.
  - Copy `ASSETS.ZIP`, `clacon.ttf`, `CLAW.REZ`, `config.xml`, `console02.tga`, `SAVES.XML` files from `Build_Release` directory to `build` directory.
  - Open `CMakeLists.txt` in project root directory, set `EMSCRIPTEN_PATH` variable and change `Emscripten` option to `ON`.
  - Compile:
    ```
    cd build
    sudo YOUR_SDK_PATH/emsdk/upstream/emscripten/emconfigure cmake ..
    sudo make
    ```
  
  **Run:**
  
  You will need web server to run compiled project. There are 2 options:
  - You can upload `openclaw.html`, `openclaw.js` and `openclaw.data` files from `Build_Release` directory to any web server.
  - Or run Python server:
    ```
    cd Build_Release
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
    # Go to http://localhost:8080/openclaw.html
    ``` 
  
  **Remarks:**
  
  There are some limitations:
  - Some old web browsers does not support WebAssembly code. *Hi Internet Explorer!*
  - Some web browsers does not support `.wav` file formats. *Microsoft? Again?*
  - All web browsers does not support `.xmi` (MIDI) file formats. This files should be converted to another compatible formats. **All MIDI audio are disabled for now**.
  - Some specific `SDL_Mixer` audio functions aren't implemented (*you can find it by `TODO: [EMSCRIPTEN]` search query*) but the game is playable.
 
# In-game images
  -  **TODO** - add screenshots

# Claw Launcher

  - Precompiled for Windows natively and for Linux use through Mono runtime
  - Locates Claw binary and corresponding config.xml file
  - Provides GUI to modify configuration (Video/Audio/Assets)

### For Linux

  **Prerequisites for Ubuntu 16.04 (should be almost identical for Fedora/CentOS/*):**
  
  `sudo apt install mono-runtime libmono-system4.0-cil libmono-system-windows-forms4.0-cil` 
  
  **Then run it like this:**
  
  `~/OpenClaw/Build_Release$ mono ClawLauncher.exe`
 
-  **TODO** - add screenshots
